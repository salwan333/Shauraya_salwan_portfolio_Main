1. The Portfolio website is a meticulously planned 2-page web platform, comprising the following sections:


* Homepage
* About me
* My work
* Contact Page


2. The design philosophy revolves around a colour scheme of light Purple, grey and black, strategically chosen to emphasise the content and the work showcased, promoting a minimalist and elegant aesthetic.


3. Homepage: The portfolio is introduced on this first landing page. There's a 'About Me' section with details about my experience and background. It also has a section with testimonials, team projects, and my most recent work (hyperlink related). Here, I want to highlight my skill set and my contributions to the fields of motion, graphic, and web design.


4. GreenSock animations will be included to improve user experience. The portfolio website will look more aesthetically appealing with the addition of dynamic and engaging scroll effects and hover animations.


5. Portfolio sites: A flexible JavaScript framework powers these sites. The way the project descriptions are dynamically displayed on these pages is one of their unique features.
6. PHP, SASS, HTML, and JavaScript are used in combination to create the "About Us," "Home," and "Projects" pages. These pages are enhanced with a variety of animation effects, which improve the website's overall user experience and engagement.


7. The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase my abilities and work in an eye-catching, polished, and visually appealing way. It's the pinnacle of functionality and design, fusing state-of-the-art design with sophisticated aesthetics to produce an engaging and educational online presence.
